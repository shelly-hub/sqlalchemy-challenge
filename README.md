# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Project Aim

This project learns the use of SQLalchemy, part of python SQL toolkit to access, manage and analyse data in sqlite file source using python scripts. 

## Project Description

This project is divided into 2 sections:

First part of project would be utilising Jupyter notebook and importing python SQL libraries, matplotlib, and pandas to explore climate data. 
2 CVS files would be used to for data exploration and analysis.

Second part of project is to utlise flask from python library to design climate web page. 

### Benefits of SQLalchemy
 - It provides a common interface for all type of database
 - Using python codes can generate more complex analysis
 - Enable to import substantial libraries to carry out different types of data modelling
 
### Disadvantages of SQLalchemy
- Intense code script needed
- Can be non-user friendly when dealing with complex analysis
- Many errors could occur from identation, capital letters and more
- Could be more time-intensive than other SQL app when dealing quick data analysis

## Project Method

###First section: Analyse and explore climate data

####First analysis: Precipitation analysis
